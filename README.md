## üìñ About The Project

Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into Computer-Aided Design (CAD) presents a fundamental challenge: LLMs operate on probabilistic correlations, while engineering demands deterministic precision and adherence to strict standards. End-to-end generative approaches often result in designs that are physically unrealizable, unstable, or non-compliant with manufacturing constraints, requiring costly manual rework.

**CAD-Daedalus** addresses this problem by architecturally reframing the LLM's role. [cite_start]Instead of being an unreliable end-to-end generator, the LLM acts as an **interactive proposal engine** within a verifiable and deterministic framework. Our core innovation is the decoupling of probabilistic intent parsing from deterministic geometric synthesis, ensuring that all generated outputs are verifiably correct and compliant with engineering standards. [cite: 15, 31]

## üèõÔ∏è Core Architecture

[cite_start]The Daedalus framework is built upon a hierarchical, three-stage architecture that systematically separates the cognitive tasks of engineering design: Analysis, Decision, and Execution. [cite: 103, 104]

### 1. Analysis Layer
[cite_start]The Analysis Layer translates unstructured, multimodal user intent (e.g., text, images) into a structured, preliminary JSON representation. [cite: 8, 213] [cite_start]It employs a dialogue-driven process to systematically resolve ambiguities, ensuring that the user's intent is captured accurately before proceeding. [cite: 220] [cite_start]This layer strictly confines the LLM to an information extraction role, populating a pre-verified JSON template derived from standard engineering libraries. [cite: 215, 217]

### 2. Decision Layer
[cite_start]This layer transforms the syntactically valid JSON from the Analysis Layer into a fully verified, engineering-compliant specification. [cite: 9, 227] [cite_start]Its core is the **Validator-in-the-Loop** mechanism. [cite: 229] [cite_start]Every proposal generated by the LLM is first routed to a deterministic Symbolic Verifier. [cite: 246] [cite_start]Any proposal that violates physical laws, manufacturing tolerances, or assembly logic is immediately discarded before it ever reaches the human user, ensuring a collaborative and error-free refinement process. [cite: 248]

### 3. Execution Layer
[cite_start]The Execution Layer is a purely **deterministic symbolic synthesis engine**. [cite: 10, 252] [cite_start]It takes the final, validated JSON from the Decision Layer and translates it into a standard-compliant engineering artifact (e.g., 2D LISP, 3D OBJ). [cite: 62, 253] [cite_start]This engine operates based on axiomatic engineering rules encoded in its core compilers, providing the ultimate guarantee that the output is verifiably correct and ready for downstream manufacturing processes. [cite: 32, 255]

## ‚ú® Key Features

Daedalus introduces several core contributions to the field of AI-assisted engineering:

-   [cite_start]**‚úÖ Verifiable Neuro-Symbolic Framework:** Separates the LLM's probabilistic reasoning from a deterministic, symbolic compiler, guaranteeing reliability and compliance with engineering rules. [cite: 107, 108]
-   [cite_start]**ü§ù Multimodal Human-AI Interaction:** A dialogue-driven refinement process that transforms the design workflow from a brittle, one-shot attempt into a robust, collaborative partnership between the user and the AI. [cite: 110, 112]
-   [cite_start]**üìä True Success Rate (TSR) Metric:** A novel, cost-aware evaluation framework that provides a more holistic and fair standard for benchmarking AI engineering systems. [cite: 113, 114]
-   [cite_start]**üîß Extensibility and Generalization:** The framework can generalize across dimensions (2D to 3D) and synergistically integrate other state-of-the-art generative models (like GNNs or Diffusion models) without requiring extensive pre-training. [cite: 14, 120]

## üñºÔ∏è Gallery: Examples of Generated Designs

[cite_start]CAD-Daedalus can generate a wide spectrum of engineering artifacts, from basic geometric primitives to complex, multi-component assemblies, all with precise dimensional and tolerance annotations. [cite: 173, 175]
