## üìñ About The Project

Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into Computer-Aided Design (CAD) presents a fundamental challenge: LLMs operate on probabilistic correlations, while engineering demands deterministic precision and adherence to strict standards. End-to-end generative approaches often result in designs that are physically unrealizable, unstable, or non-compliant with manufacturing constraints, requiring costly manual rework.

**CAD-Daedalus** addresses this problem by architecturally reframing the LLM's role. Instead of being an unreliable end-to-end generator, the LLM acts as an **interactive proposal engine** within a verifiable and deterministic framework. Our core innovation is the decoupling of probabilistic intent parsing from deterministic geometric synthesis, ensuring that all generated outputs are verifiably correct and compliant with engineering standards. 


## ‚ú® Key Features

Daedalus introduces several core contributions to the field of AI-assisted engineering:

-   [cite_start]**‚úÖ Verifiable Neuro-Symbolic Framework:** Separates the LLM's probabilistic reasoning from a deterministic, symbolic compiler, guaranteeing reliability and compliance with engineering rules. [cite: 107, 108]
-   [cite_start]**ü§ù Multimodal Human-AI Interaction:** A dialogue-driven refinement process that transforms the design workflow from a brittle, one-shot attempt into a robust, collaborative partnership between the user and the AI. [cite: 110, 112]
-   [cite_start]**üìä True Success Rate (TSR) Metric:** A novel, cost-aware evaluation framework that provides a more holistic and fair standard for benchmarking AI engineering systems. [cite: 113, 114]
-   [cite_start]**üîß Extensibility and Generalization:** The framework can generalize across dimensions (2D to 3D) and synergistically integrate other state-of-the-art generative models (like GNNs or Diffusion models) without requiring extensive pre-training. [cite: 14, 120]

## üñºÔ∏è Gallery: Examples of Generated Designs

[cite_start]CAD-Daedalus can generate a wide spectrum of engineering artifacts, from basic geometric primitives to complex, multi-component assemblies, all with precise dimensional and tolerance annotations. [cite: 173, 175]
